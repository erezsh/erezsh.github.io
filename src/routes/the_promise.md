# The Promise

<pre>
We live by the promise
That is the promise of the promise
The shine of it makes us follow

What is money? Nothing but a promise
What is love, without a promise?
What is God? An elaborate ruse
It promises an afterlife
Beyond a one-sided mirror
And all we see is ourselves
Making promises
And then scrambling
To keep them
</pre>
